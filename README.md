# HTML, CSS & JS template

## Introduction

Template HTML, CSS & JS.

ðŸš¨ The `componentGeneration.js` files are only intended to showcase the different components of the project.  
If these components need to be used in a framework, they should be split into two separate parts (not possible with vanilla HTML and JavaScript):
- `<template>`
- `<script>`  

Next to each `componentGeneration.js` file, there is an `index.html` which is the compiled render of each component.  
This allows you to adapt the code into a framework or use it natively in a vanilla project.

It is essential not to use `innerHTML` in production projects, as it constitutes a security vulnerability that can be exploited for XSS attacks.
